## Notes

(October 14th, 2021)

I've recently subscribed to Frontend Mentor to practice developing projects from mockups. I started simple with this "newbie"-level challenge in order to get a feel for the format, and everything has gone smoothly so far. I may need to reach into the higher difficulties in order to be tested in the way I want to be.

That doesn't mean this 'Order Summary' component was a complete waste of my time, though. I intend to use [Astro](https://astro.build/) for my next few projects, and this was a good opportunity to practice setting up a project with it. I also made sure to take Astro's ["hybrid"](https://docs.astro.build/guides/styling/#hybrid-scoped--utility-css) approach to CSS as seriously as I could, trying to strike a balance between sensible utility classes and scoped, component-based styles. It'll take a little more practice to get the hang of it, but I think I'm enjoying thinking about stylesheets in terms of "cascading" versus "specific" rules.
